Migrant to person
=============

This is a small project designed to highlight the use of political or loaded words and phrases when discussing the issue of migration. We feel that many of these terms act to dehumanise people seeking a better life or fleeing violence and persecution, which makes it easy to ignore their plight or portray them is a negative light.
